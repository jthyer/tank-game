I like this one a lot! The game's quietly riffing on one of the
final boss's attack patterns in Axelay, where he shoots out a bunch
of identical-looking enemies with randomly selected differing attack
patterns. I liked the pattern so much I thought it'd be fun as
an endless score attack game. Several years and about a week of work
later, here it is!

I also pulled a lot of the core engine functionality out of the 
"source" folder and put it in a new folder labeled "core". I let 
things get really messy so I could finish the game, but the idea here
is that the "core" engine takes care of common functionality like
objects, rooms, collision -- stuff that Game Maker took care of for
me back in the day. I want to make Love2d as easy to use for improvised
game dev as Game Maker, and I think this project got me a lot closer.

I like this enough that I think it could be fun to do a polished,
fleshed-out version with original art and music... but I think I want
to keep focusing on little one-off Trainwreck projects for now. If I 
can get Love2d working for me the I want it to, I'll be unstoppable.
